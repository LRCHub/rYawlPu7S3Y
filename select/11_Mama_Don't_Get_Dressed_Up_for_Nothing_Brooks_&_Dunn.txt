She said, "Hey cowboy get off of that couch
Yeah, the party's on you and we're goin' out
I got my low cut dress and my knee high boots
I'm like money to burn and nothing to lose
You're the man of the house, you better think of somethin'
'Cause Mama don't get dressed up for nothin'"

She said, "I been cooped up in this house all week
It's time to pick it up and move it down to party street"
She said, "Saddle up hoss, it's your lucky day
And I'm a she-cat tiger comin' out of the cage
Yeah, we can go high rollin' or beer joint jumpin'
Mama don't get dressed up for nothin'"

She's hard to handle, a little high strung
I'll see her bet and I'll raise her one
Ooh-whoa, I love it when she gets wound up
I'm her Jack of Hearts, she's my Lady Luck

We gonna find a little place where we can rip and roar
We gonna cut a deep groove in that hardwood floor
Set up the shooters, and break out the green
Throw a whole row of quarters in the boogie machine
We gonna turn up the heat and keep the jukebox humpin'
'Cause mama don't get dressed up for nothin'

Go high rollin' or beer joint jumpin'
'Cause mama don't get dressed up for nothin'
Yeah babe, you better think of somethin'
'Cause mama don't get dressed up for nothin'
